# DanBotHosting

📝 I am currently squatting this username as there is a company named DanBot Hosting and I don't want malicious actors to take advantage of this. <3
👀 If you're someone at DanBot Hosting and would like this username, contact me on Discord: `@hashitchu` (User ID: 1176353953668145168)
📎 The real DanBot Hosting is here: [https://github.com/DanBot-Hosting](https://github.com/DanBot-Hosting)

P.S. I don't know why they didn't choose the username `DanBotHosting` instead of `DanBot-Hosting` 💀💀
